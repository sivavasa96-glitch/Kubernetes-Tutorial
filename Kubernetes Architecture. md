Kubernetes Architecture
=========================

Kubernetes has two main parts:
1) Control Plane (Master) → Brain of the cluster
2) Worker Nodes → Where your applications actually run

1) Control Plane Components (Master / Brain)

✅ Step 1: API Server (kube-apiserver)
This is the main entry point.
When you run kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml, it goes to API Server
All requests (UI, CLI, CI/CD) talk to API Server only
👉 In short: API Server = Front door of Kubernetes
✅ Step 2: etcd (Database)
This is the key-value database of Kubernetes.
Stores cluster state like:
Pods, services, deployments
secrets, configmaps
node info
👉 In short: etcd = Kubernetes brain memory
✅ Step 3: Scheduler (kube-scheduler)
Now Kubernetes decides: “Which node should run this pod?”
Scheduler checks:
CPU / memory availability
node labels, taints, affinity rules
Then it assigns pod to the best node.
👉 In short: Scheduler = Pod placement manager
✅ Step 4: Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)
This component ensures the cluster is always in the desired state.
Example:
You said replicas = 3
If one pod dies, controller creates another pod
It handles controllers like:
Node controller
Replication controller
Job controller
👉 In short: Controller Manager = Auto-correction system
✅ Step 5: Cloud Controller Manager (in cloud like AWS/Azure)
This is used in cloud environments to manage:
Load balancers
volumes
cloud networking
👉 In short: Cloud Controller = Kubernetes talking to cloud services
2) Worker Node Components (Where app runs)
✅ Step 6: Node (Worker Machine)
Worker node can be:
VM
physical server
cloud instance
This is where your pods run.
✅ Step 7: Kubelet
Kubelet is like the agent inside every node.
It talks to API server
It ensures containers are running properly
If pod needs to start → kubelet starts it using container runtime
👉 In short: Kubelet = Node manager agent
✅ Step 8: Container Runtime (Docker / containerd / CRI-O)
This is the tool that actually runs containers.
Kubernetes doesn’t run containers directly — runtime does.
👉 In short: Runtime = Engine that runs containers
✅ Step 9: Kube-proxy (Networking)
Kube-proxy handles:
service networking
load balancing inside cluster
routes traffic to correct pod
Example: Service → forwards traffic to pod1, pod2, pod3.
👉 In short: kube-proxy = Traffic router inside cluster
