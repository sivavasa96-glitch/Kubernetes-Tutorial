what is kubernets:
==================

“Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform. It helps us deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It provides auto-scaling, self-healing, load balancing, rolling updates, and rollback. So instead of managing containers manually, Kubernetes manages everything automatically in production.”

why we use kubernets:
=====================

“We use Kubernetes to manage containerized applications in a scalable and automated way. In real projects, we have multiple microservices running as containers. Managing them manually is very difficult. Kubernetes helps us with auto-scaling, self-healing, load balancing, rolling updates, and rollback. So it ensures high availability and stability in production environments.”

If they ask for a simple explanation:


“Suppose my application is running in 3 containers. If one container crashes, Kubernetes automatically restarts it. If traffic increases, Kubernetes automatically creates more containers. That’s why we use Kubernetes — to automate and manage containers efficiently.”

what is different between docker and kubernets
===============================================

“Docker and Kubernetes serve different purposes. Docker is used to create and run containers. Kubernetes is used to manage and orchestrate those containers at scale.”
Let me explain clearly 👇

Docker
======

---
Used to build container images
Run application inside a container
Works well for single-container or small setups
Example: docker run myapp
---

Kubernetes
===========

---
Used to manage multiple containers
Handles scaling, load balancing, self-healing
Used in production for microservices
Example: automatically restart container if it crashes
